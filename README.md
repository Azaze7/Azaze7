===============

My Name is *Gilbert Guzman*, & I'm an aspiring **Cyber Security Analyst** from El Paso, Texas. 
I'm Currently Enrolled at **The University of Texas at El Paso** in Computer Science.

I've learned to write code, but I know there's always a bigger fish! 
I'm never going to stop learning, and I love that very much. 

I'm very passionate about tech, especially in regards to the front-end and user experience. I want to use my skills to help others build projects that will make the world a better place.
I'm currently focused on cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and enjoy concepting products that can made with older sytems. The *blue ocean* stategy is one that really interests me.

## üíΩ Course Work

As I am currently a Senior, I have only *four* more classes to go before my graduation. However, here are my last 10 completed courses, showing what I now have knowlege of.

-Software Engineering Requirements 1 [CS 4310] 

    ~ Methodologies, approaches, and techniques associated with software requirements analysis and definition.
    ~ First semester of a two-semester CAPSTONE project in which students worked with a customer.
    ~ Captured and specified requirements for a real-world application, to be coded in Fall 2024.
    Role: Team Leader.
    Grade: [B].
    
-Computer Networks [CS 4316]

    ~ Introduction to data communications; covered data transmission, link control, encoding, multiplexing, & switching. 
    ~ Also covered network topologies, address resolution & protocol layering, routing methods, data security, & distributed systems.
    Grade: [TBD].
    
-Wireless Networks [CS 4318]
    
    ~ Mixture of theoretical, engineering, and practical topics in contemporary wireless systems for both mobile and home devices.
    ~ Covered fundamental techniques in design and operation of the second, third, and fourth generations of wireless LANs. 
    ~ Placed a significant emphasis on the design of security-related features within wireless networks.
    Grade: [TBD].
    
-Software Vulnerablities [CS 4177] 

    ~ Hands-on workshop-style course that covered common software security vulnerabilities.
    ~ Course consisted of 10 workshops, each covering a particular current software vulnerability.
    ~ Learned WireShark, IDA, Powershell-Empire, & more.
    Grade: [A]
    
-Programming Language Concepts [CS 3360]

    ~ Design features of modern programming languages, including flow control mechanisms and data structures.
    ~ Learned techniques for implementation of these features; practiced programming in several representative languages.
    Grade: [B]
    
-Database Systems [CS 4342] 

    ~ Introduction to database fundamentals (e.g., relational algebra) and data models (e.g., entity-relationship model, relational model).
    ~ Studied the use of database management systems with an assigned course project (e.g., database design and implementation, query processing). 
    ~ Learned new paradigms for data management (e.g., non-relational data models), data integrity, privacy, and security.
    Grade: [A]
    
-Advanced Object Oriented Programming [CS 3331] 

    ~ An in-depth exposure to the object-oriented programming paradigm, which built upon programming experience gained in lower-level computer science classes.
    ~ Emphasised on programming in an object-oriented language with which students are already familiar, and on requirements, testing, code reading, and comprehension.
    ~ Advanced Java OOT Programming Project completed.
    Grade: [A]
