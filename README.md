===============

📍 Born and Raised in El Paso, Texas.
💻 Aspiring **Cyber Security Analyst**, Currently Enrolled at **The University of Texas at El Paso** in Computer Science.
💾 Data Archivist By Day, 🕹️ Game Development By Night.

**A Little About Me**
I've learned to write code, but I know there's always a bigger fish! 
I'm never going to stop learning, and I love that very much. 

I'm very passionate about tech, especially in regards to the front-end and user experience. I want to use my skills to help others build projects that will make the world a better place.
I'm currently focused on cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and enjoy concepting products that can made with older sytems. The *blue ocean* stategy is one that really interests me.

## 📼 Personal Projects

I can eat 7 cheetos without drinking water.

## 💽 Course Work
