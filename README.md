<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azaze7/Azaze7/main/Guzman_thumbsup.gif" height="40px"> Howdy! I'm Azaze7, Welcome To My Profile!
===============

My Name is *Gilbert Guzman*, & I'm an aspiring **Cyber Security Analyst** from El Paso, Texas. 
I'm Currently Enrolled at **The University of Texas at El Paso** in Computer Science.

I've learned to write code, but I know there's always a bigger fish! 
I'm never going to stop learning, and I love that very much. 

I'm very passionate about tech, especially in regards to the front-end and user experience. I want to use my skills to help others build projects that will make the world a better place.
I'm currently focused on cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and enjoy concepting products that can made with older sytems. The *blue ocean* stategy is one that really interests me.

## üíΩ Course Work

As I am currently a Senior, I have only **four** more classes to go before my graduation.

However, here are my last *ten completed courses,* showing what I am now capable of.
