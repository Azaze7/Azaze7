===============

My Name is *Gilbert Guzman*, & I'm an aspiring **Cyber Security Analyst** from El Paso, Texas. 
I'm Currently Enrolled at **The University of Texas at El Paso** in Computer Science.

I've learned to write code, but I know there's always a bigger fish! 
I'm never going to stop learning, and I love that very much. 

I'm very passionate about tech, especially in regards to the front-end and user experience. I want to use my skills to help others build projects that will make the world a better place.
I'm currently focused on cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and enjoy concepting products that can made with older sytems. The *blue ocean* stategy is one that really interests me.
