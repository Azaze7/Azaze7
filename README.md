===============

📍 My Name is Gilbert Guzman, and I'm 23 Years Old.
* I was Born and Raised in **El Paso, Texas, USA.**

💻 I'm an Aspiring ***Cyber Security Analyst / Software Developer.***
* I'm Currently Enrolled at **The University of Texas at El Paso** in Computer Science as a Senior.
* **GPA: [3.22]**

🌎 I am committed to using technology as a tool for change, fostering innovation that will **lead to a better world.**

## ⌨️ My Computer Science Story

* From an early age, I was introduced to the world of technology by my grandmother, who helped me navigate the digital landscape via AOL dial-up [📎] since I was **three years old.**

* I prefer to work on the projects of others, but when I code my own, my passion lies in front-end development and the user experience. I am deeply invested in creating interfaces that are not only functional but also **intuitive and user-friendly.** [🎮] 

* My current interests lie in the concepts of **Data Archival** [💾] and **Ethical Hacking.** [🔐] When I have some time to myself, I'll usually be reading about these topics.

## 📼 Personal Projects

I can eat 7 cheetos without drinking water.

## 📊 GitHub Stats
⚠️ Though not a fully accurate reflection of what I ***can*** do, these graphs serve as a visual representation of what I have stored here on Github.

🗄️ I tend to code my projects locally, exporting the finished ones to my repos for archive purposes. I'm working towards fixing this bad habit so that my code lives and breathes on the net. :3
